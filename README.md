## Design Sepecific CPU 

I used to desing this cpu based on MIPS architecture which execute following instructions.

  | Operation Select  |             |
  | S3 | S2 | S1 | S0 |  Operation  |
  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |  F = A      |

I installed SystmeC on Win7 and configured settings to compile on Visual Studio 2012
