## Design Specific CPU 

I used to design this cpu based on MIPS architecture which execute following instructions.

Operation Select

"S3-S2-S1-S0 --> Operation"

"0000 --> F = A", 

"0001 --> F = A + 1", 

"0010 --> F = A + B",

"0011 --> F = A - 1",

"0100 --> F = A - B",

"0101 --> F = A & B",

"0110 --> F = A or B",

"0111" --> F = A xor B",

"1000" --> F = shift right A",

"1001" --> F = shift left A"
  

I installed SystmeC on Win7 and configured settings to compile on Visual Studio 2012
