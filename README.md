## Design Sepecific CPU 

I used to desing this cpu based on MIPS architecture which execute following instructions.

  Operation Select      
  S3-S2-S1-S0-->Operation
  0000 --> F = A
  0001 --> F = A + 1
  0010 --> F = A + B
  

I installed SystmeC on Win7 and configured settings to compile on Visual Studio 2012
